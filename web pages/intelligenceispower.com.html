In relation to the above, certainly Men's rights are just as important as 
women's rights... As Women's rights are addressed and progress is made, this will not only 
lead to equal distribution of economic and social power, but will more 
generally benefit Society as a whole... both in terms of men's rights as well as 
women's rights. <br>

Women's Labor Force Attachment Patterns and Maternity Leave: A Review of the 
Literature <br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0032/twps0032.html#Abstract">http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0032/twps0032.html#Abstract
</a>
<br>
&nbsp; It is only consistent that if &quot;women's work&quot; should be 
valued equally in the private sphere and domain of the household, then they 
should progressively have equal participation in the public sphere... depending 
on people's personalities, education, circumstances and so forth. It would only 
be &quot;equal&quot; and Consistent to have undefined gender roles where either the man or 
the woman can take on the roles of a breadwinner / home-maker. Certainly any 
person who is looking out for their own Best Interest will say I want equal 
respect at home but not in the work place, ( you do the work, make the money, 
and I enjoy the fruits of women's equality ) but women certainly have the choice 
not to be selfish. For the sake of consistency, among other things, there should be 
equality in Both the private sphere ( domain of the household ) and the Public 
sphere ( depending on the talents, opportunities, education, inheritance, social 
justice and many other ideas and values ). Certainly it is only my opinion but I 
am a proponent of the Practice of equality amongst gender roles. If male's Egos 
and pride really are tied to how much money they make (especially relative to 
their heterosexual spouses), we are a sorry lot indeed --- as Einstien would 
say. Equality in gender roles means equality and equal respect in both the 
public sphere (either person being the breadwinner) and the private sphere 
(either person being the home-maker)... depending on circumstances, personality, 
who has which talents, more money, inheritance, or simply put, more POWER in 
the relationship; hence the need for that person to use their power &quot;justly&quot; to 
reach equality of gender roles. <br>
<br>
Certainly we must be fair if there is to be equality... Even if we don't live in 
a utopia or a &quot;dream world&quot; we can still strive for equality and fairness to 
create a better world for ourselves and for others. While maternity leave is 
progressive ( certainly for working women ), adoption will always be a wonderful 
option in my view. I don't really prescribe to a aristocratic philosophy of a 
&quot;blood line,&quot; or a purely selfish interest motivation for having kids only for social 
security, survival of one's race, religion or 
class! I've always compared this type of thinking to a playground where 
children only associate with their &quot;kind,&quot; or teenagers associating only with 
their &quot;cliques;&quot; be it because of their cultural background, racial background 
or 
skin color.... Even in this context of &quot;saving&quot; one's race one could consider 
adoption, hopefully with the long-term intention of having a class-less society!

<br>
The following story is very interesting.... It does not necessarily depict a &quot;normal&quot; 
circumstance for a working woman, but it does provide a somewhat realistic 
example in regards to perils of relatively recent maternity leave provisions for 
women in the United States (especially where both parents are working). On a broader 
note, a completely government subsidized social daycare system is probably not 
going to happen in the US any time soon, which is probably a good thing 
according most economists. On the other hand, hopefully A Lot more resources 
will be spent on a private daycare solution that seeks to provide 
childcare/daycare as a social good (like schools and water)... The benefits of a 
such a system for women's equality and men's equality are Tremendous. Not only 
IS the more &quot;talented&quot; person able to share their talents with society, but 
women in general ARE able to express their professional talents and make a mark 
in shaping societal history. Unfortunately as it stands in the United States, 
women are oftentimes reduced to being nothing more than trophy-cases for 
successful men and they will never be able to fully express their talents 
outside the home --- no offense ladies ; Especially to the successful working 
woman! The reason I use the present tense is because in more socialistic 
democracies like Sweden, Norway or Switzerland policies are very close to the 
alternative reality. For example, &quot;Sweden provides 15 months of parental leave 
at 75 per cent of salary&quot; ( Steve O'Neill , 2 ; from articles below ). I don't 
agree with a completely socialistic view, but in places like &quot;Finland and 
France, a choice is offered between a funded childcare place And a home care 
allowance of equivalent value for up to three years of job-protected parental 
leave&quot; (Manne, 1). <br>
&nbsp; In the Capitalistic states hopefully daycare/childcare will be highly 
government subsidized and tax-deductible for working mothers and fathers. 
Certainly, such a system would allow for respite, as was explained in Mrs. 
Glover's article above. Further, any &quot;inefficiency looses&quot; an economist might 
argue are More than made up in increased productivity by women being able to 
express their talents in the workforce, and the equality for Both Men and Women 
that ensues from such public policy. But that's just My opinion! Perhaps this 
issue will be debated in the upcoming election as Maternity leave is 
progressive, especially in the Capitalistic states. <br>

<br>
Even though the US is ahead of hundreds of countries, it is still lagging behind 
others many others... In particular, they have to stop calling maternity leave 
&quot;temporary disability&quot; --- that implies the second class citizenry of women's 
labor, de-values Motherhood, Womanhood and more generally the role of women in 
the workplace... To achieve unbiased gender definitions it is up to WOMEN as 
much as men to attain equality And fairness... even when it comes to unfortunate 
circumstances like divorce ( where the man or the woman should be seen as equal 
caregivers)... To that End, there needs to be a lot of work done to attain 
gender equality in this area. In the mean time guys.... Treat your wives as 
queens... otherwise You're going to get Creamed In Divorce Court... and they say 
character is not important...lol (as a quality in both men And women). No 
really, it's quite unfair...At bare minimum fathers should only be obligated to 
pay a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of money, as the mother is suppose to be contributing 
to the financial well being of the child as well -- or visa versa if the man has 
custody of the children (very unlikely unfortunately). It is a very important 
and serious topic to be considered --- both for men and for women --- please get 
your parents permission :) <br>

And for the Feminists ( which I actually support for the Most part -- though I 
don't always like their means / specifically their male bashing tactics ) <br>
<br>
-- What is interesting however, is the flavor of feminism which has prevailed. 
It is not the version that encourages men to be more sensitive, but instead the 
version that accepts sexual promiscuousness on the part of the woman as a 
component of women's equality --- This quote has been modified for mature 
language :) --- please refer to the article for complete language. Thank you.

It is my hope that men will be able to express both their strong and 
companionate sides, such that men are perceived to be intelligent, companionate 
creatures, rather than just macho brutes --- as a result, I hope men will have 
equal rights as mothers and I hope that these character traits will go a long 
ways in ending the horrendous 50% divorce rate!&nbsp;

&nbsp; I like this article very much because it portrays women as being empowered, 
independent and strong people rather than weak submissive creatures at the whim 
of a patriarchal society--- Which makes sense because it is a &quot;world view&quot; of 
women's rights. Certainly with &quot;girl power,&quot; the US is by no means a 
patriarchal society. &quot;It therefore commits governments to nurture key economic 
and SOCIAL RIGHTS, by introducing maternity leave with pay, promoting child 
care, and ensuring health care during pregnancy.&quot; I believe sensitivity doesn't 
mean submissive just as confidence doesn't mean ( in the context of exercising 
Amicable means, continual learning and growth ) &quot;unjustifiably&quot; Arrogant, 
Manipulative or Bossy ( certainly one could say something in a amicable way )... 
That goes for both women and men. Again, that's just my opinion! <br>

Dogma or Religious Belief? To me it sounds a bit like a dogmatic witch-hunt... 
But I guess I shouldn't judge so quickly as everyone has their &quot;interesting 
beliefs&quot;... sometimes to a deadly extent. Personally, I think Freedom Of Thought 
( to be able to think in more than one way --- ie. not making everyone think in 
the same way without their consent and know how ) is perhaps THE MOST 
FUNDAMENTAL Of Freedoms...which leads us to freedom of speech and the 
diminishing role of organized religion. <br>

universe would start at a single point, like the North Pole of the Earth. But 
this point wouldn't be a singularity, like the Big Bang. Instead, it would be an 
ordinary point of space and time, like the North Pole is an ordinary point on 
the Earth, or so I'm told. I have not been there myself&quot; ( Hawking, 2 ). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interesting thing is that according to the 
&quot;No-Boundary&quot; proposal we are going to &quot;collapse again,&quot; that doesn't 
leave much room for a caring and companionate &quot;god,&quot; but perhaps we can work 
together by that point and time to come up with a better solution!&nbsp; <br>

It is very possible that &quot;god plays dice,&quot; but it seems that the honest answer 
is still, &quot;I'm not sure.&quot; Truthfully there are to many factors and to many 
unknowns to know for sure. Perhaps a &quot;unifying theory&quot; will shed some light on 
the subject that can explain how the universe functions or doesn't function. In 
particular, in the concept of Euclidean space-time, it is not proven ( for now ) 
whether the gravatational field that allows matter to form into universes is 
indeed a steady state, or if it is in-itself expanding / contacting... I wonder 
to what extent our actions can influence the expansion /contraction of the 
Universe!</font></tt></p>
<p align="left"><tt><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
&nbsp; Further, it is conceivable that particles from an 
energy field could give way to matter forming in a random way and resulting in 
the planets and billions of variations of objects and phenomenon we observe in 
the universe. This fits with the current observations of how the Earth itself 
formed. &quot;4.6 billion years ago, the Earth formed when gravitational forces 
caused interstellar matter to accrete. The process continues today, although at 
a slow rate, as the gravitational force of the earth draws in meteorites and 
dust&quot; (Argonne National Laboratory,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/aps/frame_home.html">http://www.aps.anl.gov/aps/frame_home.html</a>). Current observations about star 
formation also fit this model. &quot;Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and William A. Fowler 
received the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics for their works on the evolution of 
stars and formation of the elements in the universe&quot; where Energy is 
converted 
from matter (
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nobel.se/physics/educational/energy/fusion_2.html">http://www.nobel.se/physics/educational/energy/fusion_2.html</a> ). This is 
further supported by Einstein's famous equation that stipulates that &quot;Everything 
in the universe is either energy or matter. Einstein realized that one could 
become the other and vice versa, immortalized in his famous equation E=mc2&quot; (

&nbsp;&nbsp; As the &quot;unifying theory&quot; becomes more objectively proven, people 
might be more inclined to believe in continual learning and growth rather than 
an all knowing or companionate &quot;god.&quot; Personally, I am quite skeptical about 
whether a Caring and Companionate &quot;god&quot; can exist. For even if She/he does 
exists, I don't think She/he functions on the premise of karma --- as &quot;good&quot; and 
&quot;bad&quot; is defined differently by different organized religions. Another way of 
saying the same thing is that we all thought the same way, There would be No 
conflicts in the world! For example, the moral set of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; in Islam 
is different than the moral set of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; in Christianity -- One 
reason for this may be that political philosophers had intended people to 
believe in caring and compassion and yet their so-called followers have 
&quot;manipulated&quot; the &quot;good&quot; moral teachings! This could be true of the Hindu caste 
system, which was originally intended to serve a purpose of &quot;fairly&quot; dividing 
work amongst people of different talents and making their rewards &quot;equitable&quot;... 
Over time the caste system, because of corrupt people/many Brahmans, become used 
as a tool for institutionalized slavery and the &quot;uneducated&quot; people were either 
to naive/unaware to do anything about it!

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter 
of moral philosophy, </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
there is a problem with organized religion in that &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; changes as 
ideas and values change... be it thru environmental changes, the 
conceptualization of new ideas/technologies or simply changes in people's 
circumstances! This of course begs the question, how can a &quot;god&quot; reward you for 
doing good deeds when the definition of &quot;good&quot; deeds changes? As a result of 
this dynamically changing definition how can there be a &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;hell&quot; if 
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; can not be firmly established and hence rewarded in these 
&quot;perfect&quot; places --- assuming that everyone wants different things! However, at 
the same time, I don't believe the original intention of organized religion was 
to define set notions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad,&quot; although malicious people have used 
thought reform to manipulate and take advantage of others --- for example the 
manipulation of the caste system from it's original intention. Moreover, the 
original intention of the moral philosophy was probably to instill character 
traits of caring and compassion, although it may be wiser be altruistic only 
with consent and understanding... This greatly precludes the ability of those 
with malicious intentions to manipulate and take advantage of anyone unfairly...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp; As a matter of 
objective reality, many people </font><tt><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
prefer heaven here on earth rather than heaven after death, especially if &quot;god&quot; 
indeed is indifferent, and each of us has a different definitions of heaven! 
Even though we may be here Completely out of randomness, chance or luck, we 
should at least be grateful for what we have in creating a better world for 
ourselves And for others, lest we depend on the likelihood of an indifferent 
&quot;god&quot; when we have only One life to live. Death may not be the 
opposite of life, especially if you believe in the life-cycle of matter and 
energy, but 
many people do prefer Life over death --- at least a life that allows them to 
seek happiness for themselves in this particular lifetime and leaving a better 
world for future generations to enjoy! </font></tt></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter 
of public policy, each of us has to decide whether &quot;fairness&quot; entails short-term 
gains over long-term heavy losses... It's a matter of choice, hence I hope 
people choose to exercise perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness&quot; beyond the 
present moment, rather than systematically &quot;torturing&quot; others... Equally 
important, the more knowledgeable the society in which we live the more &quot;just&quot; 
the definition of &quot;fairness&quot; that prevails! </font>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
This is especially true since we can greatly reduce the role of luck/ &quot;god's 
grace&quot; in attaining our physical and social needs via learning from the 
objective world! Technological progress gives us the capacity to end hunger and 
create a more equitable society, but it also gives us the power to kill each 
other 5-times over!&nbsp; While our preferences may be somewhat different, we 
can all benefit from research/learning/conceptualizations from the objective 
world in attaining our &quot;happiness,&quot; especially if happiness entails meeting your 
physical and social needs! Rather than falling into the perils of apathy 
extending from an indifferent &quot;god,&quot; I hope that people will surround themselves 
with those that help them attain their happiness, while creating a better world 
for themselves and others...all sentient beings... for the purposes of attaining 
and maintaining perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness....&quot; For on an individual 
level we can only try, but together we can move mountains with our collective 
efforts!</font></p>

In considering the means, while community service is a 
wonderful thing that everyone should partake in, I think the broader 
rationalization for doing community service should not for some benefit ( 
positive karma points ) in this life time or the next lifetime, but rather to 
simply help out someone who Needs help. This functions to remove the thought 
control component and to analyze the reasoning behind WHY the person is doing 
&quot;good.&quot; ( whether they are truly unselfish or if their unselfishness is really 
an investment to be repaid in this lifetime or the next lifetime ) Mother Terisa's work with the poorest of the poor is unmatched, and exemplifies the 
essence of TRUE RELIGIOSITY, but I disagree with the means when she says &quot;I 
know God won't give me more than I can handle.&quot; While all of our intentions 
should be so good as Mother Terrisa's, on a broader scale it is a folly to 
&quot;good&quot; only for some benefit in this life-time or the next lifetime. One certainly doesn't 
have to save the world, but at bare minimum one should think beyond meeting 
one's physical and social needs. Hopefully there is more to life then just 
your happiness -- as charity begins at home, but it Does not end there --- ie 
help yourself and help others. I guess selfish interest rules the world, but I 
hope that human altruism would lead people to seek happiness for others as well! 
Hopefully this happiness is more than a bi-product of people doing what's best 
for themselves --- which is the basis of modern economics --- everyone doing 
what's best for themselves in seeking their happiness and the results of which 
function to help society at large. This is of course assuming everyone who wants 
to work is able to work, and is able to earn &quot;enough&quot; money to be happy. While 
your work is your service to humanity, people should do &quot;good&quot; because they are 
unselfish and expect no reward or Reciprocity from &quot;god&quot;; otherwise it's Simply 
a Business Decision for one's own benefit to be repaid in this life-time or the 
next lifetime. Or in other words, &quot;If people are good only because they fear 
punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed&quot; (Albert 
Einstein). <br>

<br>
<br>
On a personal note, what is the point of trying in the first place if god will 
do what is best... I suppose it becomes somewhat of a partnership then between 
how much you are willing to do, and how much &quot;god&quot; is willing to do on your 
behalf. It becomes a very difficult balance to strike in &quot;doing your best&quot; and 
leaving the rest up to &quot;god&quot; when your &quot;best&quot; is not 
necessarily defined by 
&quot;god.&quot; I'm sure your best is somewhat derived from competition in school, in the 
corporate world ( perhaps globally ) or a myriad of other motivations. Further, 
what if you have a mental illness, physical illness or if you simply grew up in 
a poor, high-crime neighborhood.&nbsp; I suppose &quot;god&quot; has his own algorithm to deal 
with these complexities. I'm not exactly sure where to strike a balance with 
god's grace and Having control of your own destiny ( in the context of 
considering your circumstances --- hopefully you weren't born in the ghetto, and 
you didn't go to jail for 30 years for a crime you did not commit) as compared 
to the likelihood that luck, chance, circumstance, and Randomness Are In-fact the same thing as god's grace. <br>

&quot;It is a folly for a man to pray to the gods for that which he has the power to

&quot;I do not feel obliged to believe the same God who endowed us with Sense, 
Reason, and Intellect had also intended us to forego their use&quot; [Galileo Galilei].
<br>
<br>
Certainly to believe in an organized religion is not required, Nor desirable, for 
it is only a vehicle in the pursuit of a &quot;god&quot; or &quot;gods.&quot; Personally, I feel it 
is a un-necessarily institution for you can hope and prey to a personal god in a 
community center ( that brings all people together ) rather than a segregatory 
institution of only one particular organized religion. For that matter, one could 
prey for hope ( and seek faith ) from any number of infallible &quot;all knowing&quot; 
beings --- be it a blue elephant, a mystical goblin, an all knowing &quot;big 
brother&quot; ( that is either indifferent or companionate ) as Was and Is used in a 
communist system, an all knowing Yoda or a Feminist Greek Goddess! --- which I prefer for the sake of at least women's equality and 
perhaps &quot;justice&quot; for all Sentient beings. <br>
<br>
&quot;Religion is comparable to a childhood neurosis.&quot; Sigmund Freud. <br>

&quot;You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on 
evidence, it's based on a deep-seated need to believe.&quot; <br>
- Carl Sagan <br>
<br>
Certainly this does not bar the problem that still exists with False hope, which 
leads us to the Perils of Apathy. At bare minimum, I feel organized religion MUST 
encourage, rather than DIS-courage Freedom Of Thought; for without freedom of 
thought you will always be a slave to the &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; defined by a 
particular moral set, and your realization of a personal &quot;god&quot; will only depend 
on your mental estimation of reality --- a self for filling prophecy that there 
might be a &quot;blue elephant.&quot; To question god is not to dis-like him, but just to 
question whether he is indeed a companionate and caring &quot;god&quot; that cares for all 
sentient beings IN THIS WORLD AND LIFETIME; I'm not concerned about any 
speculative previous life-times or any possible future worlds from the 
consequences of &quot;karma.&quot; --- assuming you could establish the 
definition of 
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; over constantly changing ideas and values, and different moral 
sets of different organized religions! <br>

***&quot;Religious suffering is at one and the same time the expression of real 
suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the 
oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless 
conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the 
illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call 
on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to 
give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is 
therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the 
halo.&quot; [Karl Marx] <br>

&nbsp; &quot;I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute-

preference--and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion 
differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect 
him.&quot; <br>

The Penalty of Imprisonment <br>
I Highly Recommend Reading This One. It not only examines Human Nature and 
Social Needs, but also the human condition so to speak - at least for some of the 
less fortunate amongst us... It's really worthwhile, especially for the Lawyers, 
even though they may already know the ideas presented in this article. <br>
<br>
It's a bit to much reality, but it is simply intriguing... You may want to get 
your parents permission --- it's a touchy subject as you might imagine. Although 
it is very intriguing and makes you appreciate what you have to some degree, 
those that may interpret it as &quot;negativity&quot; instead of simple reality for the 
less fortunate, may not want to read all of it. Personally, I think we put too 
much money in the opposite direction; building, maintaining, training, and 
supplying resources and people to run the Judicial System, instead of spending a 
lot more money on education and Valuing teachers so that people don't Become 
&quot;criminals&quot; in the first place... I think it costs something like 55-67K a year 
to house a prisoner Depending on the circumstance. It's close to 13-17K for 
housing expenses, plus guards, facilities, electricity &amp; utilities, lawyer &amp; 
judge fees, transportation costs, Not to mention the productivity lost due to 
these people being in jail rather than being HEALTHY members of society and the 
workforce. It is quite ironic that we spend so much money to house a person in 
jail when by just giving them 50K a year you could save time, resources and 
money --- as I am pretty sure most reasonable people will not be committing any 
kind of crime if they received $50,000 ( tax free ) a year for being left alone 
and not having to live in a prison environment- LOL. I hope you find this paper 
educational and intriguing. <br>

Very interesting quote: <br>
&quot;God is a comedian playing to an audience too afraid to laugh.&quot; - Voltaire. One 
of France's greatest writers and Philosophers whose works opitimize the Age of 
&quot;Enlightenment.&quot; He was imprisoned in the Bastille prison for eleven months for 
writing a scathing satire of the French government. Ironically, his writings 
become the national symbol of French Philosophy and to this day are part of the 
French way of thinking... His heart, removed from his body, now lies in the 
Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris ( One of the oldest royal libraries in the world 
). He also has a library and a city named after him, &quot;Ferney-Voltaire,&quot; in 
Switzerland. Not bad for a guy that went to jail! <br>
<br>
&nbsp; In regards to the above, I think people should focus on and consider the ideas 
and values involved rather than how many acronyms people have after their name, 
or the amount of paper in their wallet... some of the most &quot;educated&quot; people, be 
it Hitler, the nazi doctors, Stalin, Ossama, Bush, the rich business man looking 
out for his pocketbook and serving his own best interest etc. etc. etc. don't 
necessarily hold the most guiding of principles.... Let us consider the ideas 
and values involved... and have a Peaceful discourse that serves as an amicable 
vehicle for change..... but that's just an pinion! <br>

The following article relates wonderfully to the above article and supports the 
claims of Mrs. Cooper to some degree. Certainly there is a grey area, but I 
wonder to what extent people with disassociate disorders can be held responsible 
for their actions. &quot;Without free will, the concept of &quot;responsibility&quot; makes no 
sense, and legally, criminals should not be held accountable for their actions' 
(8). In considering the idea of exonerating those who suffer from DID and have 
committed a crime related to the manifestations of the disorder, it is not 
difficult to imagine the potential scope of the diagnosis as a legal tool&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always thought it weird that in a aristocratic class-based society 
there can be any form of &quot;justice,&quot; when those at the bottom have little vehicle 
for equality because of little or no healthcare, expensive higher education and 
plenty of jails ready to entice them to work at fast food, join a military that 
aims to use them as pons in a political game of the aristocrats, clothing 
manufacturing industries border lining sweatshops (eg. in LA ), 
farming/agriculture and other labor intensive industries that hardly conform to 
any standard of equality. Certainly their mental health is affected by poverty, 
drugs and family problems relating to abuse and alcoholism manifested oftentimes 
out of their circumstances. I suppose inequality among other things drives 
people to resort to illegal ways of making money ( or creative tax &quot;management,&quot; 
as tax planning laws themselves are favored towards the Rich --- convenient how 
the system is set up isn't it :) ) On the other hand, there is the equal 
distribution of misery :) There is a particular paper written by a Canadian 
economist who claims there are few efficiency loses in a social democracy 
because the tax system is more efficient. In my estimation a more efficient tax 
system comes from the fact that people are more willing to pay taxes in a social 
democracy because they know they will receive the healthcare, higher education 
and other social goods they deserve; Unless of course you are really rich, then 
you are better of moving to a Capitalistic system, pay less taxes and receive 
private healthcare!</font></tt></p>
<p align="left"><tt><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
It also implies that the more efficient the tax collection process is, the less 
likely people will be able to practice &quot;Creative accounting,&quot; although people 
can be quite creative when tax rates reach between 40-70%!! - lol. I suppose the 
equal distribution of misery in social healthcare, higher education and other 
venues is not always attractive, but it must be balanced at least in some 
respects to the poverty and unequal distribution of wealth that exists in a 
capitalistic system. If it is managed properly, then it can work wonderfully as 
is the case in Sweden... and not to many inputs from poor populations that burden the social 
services system; basically only let people in the country if you are Going To 
Treat Them With Respect And &quot;Fairness&quot; --- not as second class citizens! I suppose a similar way of saying the same thing 
is if you are going to educate a populace, if you are going to provide them with 
quality healthcare, if you are going to provide for their higher-education, you 
are less likely to send them off in a war, ( that might not be justified ) to see 
them killed for it is a waste of your resources and time. In this major regard, 
I much prefer a socialistic democracy. You will only go to war when it is 
&quot;justified,&quot; for the cost of sending troops is extremely high, since you spent 
all this money, resources and energy to provide for their education! </font></tt></p>

For 
example, poor minorities ( class members ) are disproportionately represented in 
the military...mostly Hispanics and African Americans, while whites are more 
often than not, the generals ( I don't particularly like the army anyways 
because they brainwash people and discourage free thought, as Einstein pointed 
out in his essay. It should rather be a voluntary system that Encourages free 
thought and then allows people to consent fully participate in wars --- that way 
solders can NOT use the classical excuse in war crimes and genocide ( as was 
used in Nazi Germany and in Vietnam )... &quot;That I was Just Following Orders.&quot; I 
suppose it all comes down to Opportunity Cost... where as the opportunity cost 
of not joining the military in a socialistic democracy is free higher education 
and a decent standard of living... in the United States the opportunity cost of 
a poor man is either to join the military or just be poor....considering how 
expensive higher education is. I just hope the solders that survive with their 
mental and physical health intact are actually given the college money they 
joined the military for. It is more of a class issue than it is a Race issue...( 
though certainly not all black men, Hispanics or discriminating &quot;rednecks&quot; are 
poor by any means ). You'll have to read this article fully in order to 
understand what I'm talking about ;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, at bare minimum, education in a 
Capitalistic system should be VERY inexpensive ( and highly tax deductible from 
taxes-owed ) and a capitalistic system must provide a Decent level of free 
healthcare to all ( ie a bi-lateral healthcare system available to all, 
including certainly women, for &quot;women's health needs&quot; exist irregardless of 
healthcare availability. Providing frugal healthcare on the basis of 
establishing poverty hardly conforms to any notion of equality and simply 
re-affirms the class system in which we live; If you aren't completely aware of 
how medical and medicare works; here you go --
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/states/maag2003.pdf">http://www.cms.hhs.gov/states/maag2003.pdf
</a>). Without these basic forms of 
equality ( that of healthcare and very inexpensive higher education ( accompanied 
by big tax deductions for student loans ) &quot;equal opportunity&quot; for the lower 
class will drifts away to mere randomness and luck ( ie the entertainment 
industry, sports and the &quot;creative economy&quot; ) as higher education (be it on 
intellectual discrimination) becomes a luxury for the rich... <br>
<br>
I suppose the most fundamental route to Social Justice in capitalism is a 
Living Wage not based on intellectual discrimination: <br>

&quot;Education is one of the pillars of Nordic society. Illiteracy is practically 
non existent from Iceland to Finland, and the free national education systems 
breed some of the most skilled workforce in the world. Moreover, when it comes 
to equality between women and men, all the five Nordic countries top the index 
and score again the highest; Iceland takes the lead in terms of emancipation, 
followed by Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland on the fifth position&quot; ( The UN 
Council - article presented below ). <br>
<br>
&nbsp; But I suppose even adversity is relative to some extent ( without regard to 
considering social costs of these inequalities ). Still, I completely disagree 
with the premise of economic equality that compromises people's mental and 
physical health for the sake of more &quot;efficient economics&quot; ( atleast in the 
short-term perspective ) Or a deep-rooted aristocratic philosophy of whiteness. I 
doubt that people who wrote in the constitution &quot;all men are equal,&quot; wrote it 
with implication to non-white males. Hopefully one day this statement will be 
Honesty ( perhaps with regards to considering each person's character, along 
with their mental health and physical health, be ) applied equally to all men 
AND WOMEN. <br>

&quot;Can we sell American Globalization, Democracy, Human Rights, and Capitalism to

Poverty! The soup kitchens find themselves in a crises with food shortages and 
more and more people (citizens) are appearing sleeping on the very streets of 
New York City. All while the Rich get richer and give themselves deeper tax 
cuts?&quot; - Tuesday, November 14, 2000 - Dr. Larry T. Gell ( Here are Dr. Gell's

&quot;Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of 
labor, and could never have existed if Labor had not first existed. Hence, labor 
is superior to capital, and deserves much the higher consideration&quot; [Abraham 
Lincoln]. <br>
<br>
&quot;We want more schoolhouses and less jails; more books and less arsenals; more 
learning and less vice; more leisure and less greed; more justice and less 
revenge; in fact, more of the opportunities to cultivate our better natures, to 
make manhood more noble, womanhood more beautiful, and childhood more happy and 
bright&quot; [Samuel Gompers]. <br>
<br>
I have always wondered why Capitalism never considers the social costs of their 
efficient economics, as compared to the social benefits of lower poverty, less 
crime ( as in Switzerland or Sweden ), more education and less mental and 
physical health problems that sometimes/oftentimes follow from poverty... 
certainly no system is perfect ( as socialistic democracies have higher 
unemployment rates Usually, not always, AND are less welcoming to poor 
immigrants for government handouts ) but a system that breeds societal altruism 
certainly has something to offer to the United States. Sweden, for example has 
lower unemployment than the united states, even while it offer quality 
helathcare and higher education to all it's citizens. Granted that it has 
relatively few immigrants as compared to the United States and it is much 
smaller in size, but it still definitely&nbsp;offers a lot to be learned! <br>

&quot;Sweden ranks first as having the fewest people living in poverty and the fewest 
illiterate people, while other rich countries such us the United States have the 
the most, showing that stark inequality persists even in middle or high-income 
countries&quot; ( Child poverty rate in the United States is 22.4%&nbsp; --</font></tt></p>

I like this quote : &quot;In the past two decades, however, the revolutionary 
advances in the neurosciences have brought mind and body, emotion and molecule 
together in ways that tend to give words a new therapeutic currency&quot; ( Bulger, 
8 ). <br>
<br>
Although this article is not the most recent, it is interesting for two 
reasons. One, the importance of the ideas presented, especially for the time in 
which it was written and it's impact ( or rather attempted impact ) on policy 
thereafter. And secondly, it allows us to concretely look at how things have/or 
have not changed since the time this lecture was delivered. This is probably 
most keen to a physician's point-of-view. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure how practical this is, but I agree with this quote on its grounds 
of compassion... &quot;Thoughtful physicians must rally more intensely around the 
vision of their Hippocratic tradition; they should encourage their leaders to 
worry less about the governmental threat, less about the threat of the business 
coalitions, less about the threat of the for-profit chains, less about the 
corporatization of medical practice, and to worry more about preserving the 
essentials of the profession of scientific healing, begun by Hippocrates and 
threatened as never before by our incredible scientific, technologic, and 
financial suc-cesses and by our own ignorance, inattention, and misunderstanding 
of the very essence of physicianhood.&quot; ( Bulger, 35 ). <br>

Eventhough there are likely be more delays in treatment if everyone has 
healthcare ( ie rationed care ) --- at least 40,000,000 people are not going to be 
without any health insurance, as is the case in the United States:: <br>

&quot;The inherent vice of capitalism is the uneven division of blessings, while the 
inherent virtue of socialism is the equal division of misery&quot; [ Sir Winston 
Churchill ]. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is interesting that most people don't consider the social costs of 
undiagnosed/untreated physical and mental illnesses, especially when considering 
the cost of emergency care. Consider for a moment the number of people with 
un-diagnosed or untreated mental and physical illnesses, let alone being able to 
treat their illnesses properly. I wonder to what extent people consider the 
social costs that arise from these factors. Those with contagious diseases that 
are undiagnosed, those with mental illnesses that cause violence, involuntary 
&quot;spacing out&quot; or simply loss of &quot;mature&quot; functioning brings social costs to 
society not only in terms of their impaired mental and physical function in 
family, life and soceity, but in terms of lower personal achievement, greater 
violence and other social ills. I suppose to some extent these mental illnesses 
arise from people's circumstances, which often caused the physical or mental 
impairments in the first play ( like living in poverty, in a abusive family, or 
a society that breeds negative stereotypes of them ). I wonder to what extent 
the benefit of alleviating these social costs from society overshadow (by 
providing healthcare to 40,000,000) any potential &quot;inefficiency losses&quot;... 
especially when considering the social costs of the alternative and the benefit 
of a public/private healthcare system in the long-term mental and physical 
health of a society. Certainly it's only one perspective, but it is still my 
perspective.... <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing is perfect, but I much prefer a blending of a public and private care 
system so 40 million people are not left to suffer &quot;unnecessarily&quot; at the hands 
of Capitalistic interests. Perhaps we shall see this issue raised in the 
upcoming election as well ::

I Truly find it surprising that Feminists of all people have not rallied for 
social healthcare in this country, or at least a bi-lateral system. If not for 
healthcare for all people, then at least for healthcare that address &quot;women's 
health issues.&quot; certainly both men and women utilize healthcare when they get 
sick, but any definition of practical equality for women can not be established 
without access to quality healthcare for All women in addressing &quot;women's 
issues.&quot; Be it regular checkups, procedures or a number of &quot;women's health 
issues,&quot; it seems that women will always be in an economic disadvantage in a 
society that seeks to require women to take care of &quot;women's health issues,&quot; via 
their own private funds rather than recognizing the role healthcare plays in 
empowering women to be MORE empowered and &quot;equal&quot; 
members of society. Again, that's just my opinion, because I am a proponent of equality as 
&quot;sameness.&quot; ( The following are presented as an informal medical journal so

In summary I would like to present the following paper. It is quite short and 
ends on a note of hope. Perhaps, in our pursuit of materialistic wealth (as he 
who dies with the most toys wins!) we will Inadvertently be inclined to 
learn something along the way through higher education and endless learning. And 
so there is hope for the dignity of humanity and for the love for learning (and 
certainly Imagination) that may bring some peace in this world --- in my 
opinion :) I say this because technology is only a tool... Just as applied theoritical physical can produce instrument of destruction by converting matter 
into energy;
<a target="_blank" href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-bomb.htm">http://people.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-bomb.htm</a> technology can also be be 
used to supports life;
<a target="_blank" href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power.htm">http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power.htm</a> ||
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.space.com/news/nasa_nuclear_020205.html">http://www.space.com/news/nasa_nuclear_020205.html</a> --- it is all a matter of 
learning and understanding. In the same way that matter is converted to energy 
in nuclear reactors to produce power or a hydrogen bomb... If E is indeed = MC2 
then according to Professor Hawkings and Mr. Einstien it is likely (though not 
fully understood yet) that energy could also be converted to matter ( perhaps 
in a random way ) to create the beginning of universes (from the gravitational 
field) described in Mr. Hawkings article above (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/text/public/bot.html">http://www.hawking.org.uk/text/public/bot.html</a>). 
What is more important is that with continual learning and growth... we ( as 
humans ) must control for abuse of power and establish equal distribution of 
power.... so that there is &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Fairness&quot; in 
society. <br>
<br>
&quot;Never regard study as a duty, but as the enviable opportunity to learn to know 
the liberating influence of beauty in the realm of the spirit for your own 
personal joy and to the profit of the community to which your later work 
belongs&quot; [Albert Einstein] -- for clarification Beauty as defined by 
Webster's is 
&quot;the quality that gives pleasure to the mind or senses and is associated with 
such properties as harmony of form or color, excellence of artistry, 
truthfulness, and originality.&quot; In this context, you may want to consider continual 
learning and growth because the beauty of the mind is as important, if not more 
important in the long-run!&nbsp; </font></tt></p>

		Keynote speech by Dr Patrick Dixon (physician and futurist) for gene 
		technology companies and biotech analysts / investors in Zurich. 
		Audience of 150 - October 2002. <br>
		<br>
		Dr. Dixon is quite right, expect that biotech and the digital 
		revolutions are not two, independent things! They are in fact married 
		technologies that will likely revolutionize how the world thinks, 
		functions and works via nano-computers :

		What A Brave New world : Personally, I'm for stem cell research, organ 
		regeneration and possibly even human cloning in extra-ordinary 
		circumstances ( depending on the long-term effects ) ... but not like 
		this... I guess it's a matter of perception, but it is my opinion! <br>
		Human cloning, Human genetics and Brave New World <br>

		It's interesting to note that in the world of bio-technology the 
		definitions of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are not firmly 
		established as of yet! I wonder how god would attest to such 
		circumstance? <br>
		<br>
		I guess our reality often depends on what we make of it! <br>

The Chandra X-ray Observatory is one of the most utilized tools in astronomy 
today! In particular, to understand the cycle of matter and energy it is an 
essential tool for understanding, what is energy? &quot;Solving the riddle of dark 
energy is likely to dramatically change our fundamental understanding of space, 
time and even perhaps how gravity works.&quot;&nbsp; <b>More importantly</b>, it 
will likely prove the no-boundary proposal and lead to a holistic theory of 
human behavior! (

&quot;Using the combined data, Allen and his colleagues found that dark energy makes 
up about 75% of the Universe, dark matter about 21%, and visible matter about 
4&quot; <br>
<br>
As technology itself advances, hopefully human behavior will be driven by 
perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness,&quot; as opposed to systematically &quot;torturing&quot; 
others, all sentient beings. Our capacity to do both increases as technology 
advances, including our understanding of &quot;dark energy.&quot; As the probabilities 
indicate, the 
energy extracted from this fundamental foundation of nature -- quantum energy -- 
will be Much greater than that of the atom, ie atomic energy.&nbsp; <br>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The more interesting point of the above

</a>... Globalization effects not only Indian workers, but US workers as well.. 
hence the intention to clarify the numbers... Rather than exaggerating the 
number of Indians abroad, or giving people false hope that globalization will 
lead to more equal distribution, I think it's a much better idea to look at 
things objectively! In both cases, 
knowledge of the objective world is required in order to make a &quot;fairer&quot; 
judgment, the more specific the better! </font></tt></p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to social theory, economics and ethics... each 
individual has to decide what they believe in, and the sub of these beliefs 
represent the values of any given society. Although each culture has a Different 
Degree of social justice, I do not believe in cultural 
relativism, which says that &quot;good&quot; in one culture can be bad in another and 
visa-versa... In my opinion &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; can not be defined, hence what is 
more significant is a system of thought that transcends culture and time. 
Therefore, I choose to believe in attaining and maintaining perceptions of caring and 
&quot;fairness,&quot; which is based on our under-lying assumptions and continual learning 
and growth! The interesting thing is that perceptions vary, which cases culture clashes 
and more generally unfortunate differences between people! With more diplomacy, 
understanding, communication and knowledge of the objective world, people are 
less likely to be nieve, and more likely to reach consensus in attaining and 
maintaining perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness..&quot; </font></tt></p>
<p><tt><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To some the 
ideas of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; changing is as difficult to grasp as dealing with 
change itself. From an objective viewpoint, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; is constantly changing as ideas and 
values change via new ideas/technological progress, environmental changes and 
changes in people's circumstances. And while our perception continues to change, 
we an either Choose to shape our circumstances and systematically &quot;torture&quot; 
others (all sentient beings), or we can choose to use the power of knowledge to 
exercise perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness...&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; As and individual 
and collective choices we all have to decide whether we believe in short-term 
gains and long-term losses (long-term being beyond this present moment. Even 
mathematically, in attaining wealth and power, the most optimal solution is Not selfish interest 
but doing what's best for yourself And for the group. Hopefully this leads to 
equal distribution of power and control for abuse of power, while preserving 
individual freedoms of speech and thought that serve as important tools for 
change ---- The Nash equilibrium <br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium

<br>
&quot;Indeed, game theory, with the Nash equilibrium at its centerpiece, is becoming 
the most prominent unifying theory of social science&quot; (Charles A. Holt). <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While corporate investment and development are certainly important, equally 
important are the conditions under-which they conduct business... For example, trans-national corporations &quot;keep their financial 
headquarters offshore to protect themselves from taxes. Thereby, they lack 
financial accountability to the states in which they conduct their primary 
operations.&quot; (United Nations). It's not Only what you do, but how you do it --- 
which of course is based on our perception... Hence I hope people Choose to 
believe in attaining and maintaining perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness,&quot; based 
on our underlying assumptions and continual learning and growth!

The Nash Equilibrium: A Perspective <br>
Charles A. Holt and Alvin E. Roth <br>
<br>
&quot;Before game theory, economists often analyzed markets simply in terms of the 
supply and demand of the goods to be sold, with no way to discuss the rules of 
the game that make one kind of auction different from another, or make auctions 
different from other kinds of markets (such as stock markets, or shopping 
malls). Today, that discussion is most often carried forward by analyzing the 
Nash equilibria of the auction rules&quot; ( Roth , 5 ) <br>

The Freedom From Religion Foundation is ahead 
of it's time in not only promoting free-thought necessary for &quot;fairness&quot; and 
progress in society, but also understanding how so-called religious people 
have &quot;manipulated&quot; the religious texts to bring harm to either women, poor 
people or minorities (especially homosexuals)...

&quot;During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity 
been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride and 
indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, 
superstition, bigotry and persecution.&quot; - James Madison </font></tt></p>
<p>As a matter of Objective Reality : <tt><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&quot;Hands that help are far better than lips that pray.&quot; - Robert G. Ingersoll <br>
<br>
To look 
out for one's happiness is definitely a good thing, but I wonder to what extent 
one should balance this with being altruistic --- otherwise we'd just be 
extremely greedy people looking out Only for our welfare! On the other hand, since altruism has not 
end, you might want to considering believing in attaining and maintaining 
perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness,&quot; which is based on our underlying assumptions and 
continual learning and growth! <br>

&quot;But the one innovation that reserves Indian science its place in history was 
the invention of the place-value number system. The decimal system had been 
known already in the Indus civilization, where sets of weights in units of 1, 2, 
5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 had been in use. The remarkable rigors of Indian 
philosophy and logic provided without doubt the conditions for the important 
step to get away from the representation of numbers as multiples of objects 
(sticks, tokens, pebbles etc.) and embrace the idea of the numeral as an 
abstract concept. It is such a groundbreaking achievement that we rightly spent 
an entire lecture on it.&quot; <br>

&nbsp; Elementary-particle physics is basic research, driven by intellectual 
excitement and the desire to understand the underlying structure of the 
universe. Its discoveries illuminate all of science, and the technology 
developed in the course of this research may ultimately be applied for practical 
benefit. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Synchrotrons were developed to accelerate particles, cause collisions that 
create new particles, and provide clues about their interactions. A by-product 
of accelerating particles is the production of intense electromagnetic radiation 
from the visible part of the spectrum all the way to x rays. Several 
laboratories now operate synchrotrons purely for the purpose of generating such 
radiation; they are invaluable for researchers in surface chemistry, materials 
science and engineering, environmental science, and biology. Biological 
applications are growing at a rapidly accelerating pace and promise to give new 
insights into living systems. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Devices and techniques developed for elementary-particle physics research 
are important in several medical imaging techniques. Computer-aided tomography 
(the CT scan) and positron-emission tomography (the PET scan) use detectors 
largely developed for particle physics experimentation. Development of the 
industrial capability to produce large quantities of high-quality 
superconducting wire, in order to meet the demands of particle accelerators, led 
directly to the billion-dollar world market in this wire, primarily for use in 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • The World Wide Web, which was developed to enable elementary-particle 
physicists around the world to share information quickly and easily, now gives 
every school with a computer access to the largest library of information on the 
globe. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; These and other offshoots have been immensely valuable and have had a profound 
impact on other sciences and on our society. Elementary-particle physicists take 
pleasure in making these contributions for the good of society, but their main 
goal is to understand the universe: why it looks the way it does today, how it 
evolved from the earliest moments, and what its ultimate fate will be. The 
intellectual significance of the field is reflected in the number of Nobel 
Prizes awarded to elementary-particle physicists, in the illumination that 
elementary-particle physics has provided to other branches of science, and most 
important, in the new picture it is developing of the way in which fundamental 
particles and forces shape our world. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; National support of endeavors such as astronomy and elementary-particle 
physics is dedicated to the proposition that deepening our knowledge of the 
world we inhabit increases the pleasure, richness, and value of life. When a 
nation takes pride in contributing to such explorations, it says something 
important about itself. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; The scientific strength of the United States in the field of 
elementary-particle physics is manifest in the quality and influence of the 
research it carries out. Members of this community, traditionally some 2,000 
strong, have played important and leading roles in obtaining incisive 
experimental results, coaxing innovative technologies into existence, and 
developing important breakthroughs in theory. One measure of excellence is the 
fact that many of the best students in the world choose to come to the United 
States for their graduate training. Another is the leading role that U.S. 
physicists currently play in preparing and executing experiments aimed at 
addressing many of the most significant research questions in the field. <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; • In addition, evidence of super symmetry would also support another even more 
comprehensive theory, called string theory. Traditionally, elementary particles 
have been modeled as points that take up no space at all. This approach leads to 
some theoretical problems because two particles could (in principle) get 
extremely close and exert arbitrarily large forces on each other. String theory 
solves this problem by picturing particles as extremely tiny vibrating loops, 
with the details of their <b>vibrations</b> determining their properties and 
interactions. This simple idea, with the aid of recent theoretical developments, 
leads to a theory that is able to encompass all of the forces of nature in a 
unified and self-consistent manner, including—for the first time—gravity. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; When particles of sufficiently high energy collide, new particles are created 
out of the energy of the collision. The higher the energy of the collision, the 
more massive are the particles it can produce. There are strong theoretical 
arguments that the key to understanding some of the most important issues before 
elementary-particle physics today is attaining a high rate of collisions in the 
tera-electron-volt (TeV; 1012eV) range, today's energy frontier. <br>
<br>
<br>
========================================================== <br>
<br>
&nbsp; An important aspect of experiments at all these accelerators is the great 
complexity and sophistication of the apparatus at the business end of the 
accelerator. Very high energy collisions generate a vast profusion of particles. 
To separate out the interesting events requires complex systems of detectors to 
trace the paths of the particles, using extremely high-speed electronics to 
evaluate the events in real time. All of this equipment must have capabilities 
that far exceed those available commercially. The processing power of the custom 
high-speed electronics used to untangle the massive bursts of data that cascade 
out of the detectors compares with the capabilities of the fastest 
supercomputers. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; Over the next two decades, questions of the greatest importance to 
understanding the universe at its most fundamental level will at last come 
within reach of experiment. How elementary particles acquire their mass and 
whether the known forces are simply manifestations of a single underlying force 
are two of the most significant issues that must be addressed in comprehending 
the world around us. It is deep and profound questions such as these that first 
capture the imaginations of bright young people, whether or not they work in 
particle physics, leading them to and sustaining them on the challenging and 
difficult road to a technological education. These are the very bright young 
people that eventually become our scientists and engineers. The committee 
believes that these issues are sufficiently compelling that the U.S. particle 
physics community should play a leading role in the international endeavor to 
conduct research capable of addressing them. If the recommendations in this 
report are adopted, the United States can be at the forefront of this profound 
and fascinating intellectual adventure. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; We are poised on the threshold of a new energy frontier, where discoveries are 
certain to be made and new phenomena are likely to be revealed. This is the TeV 
mass scale, where both well-established theory and revolutionary ideas predict 
new physics. First, the remarkable success of the Standard Model ensures that 
the secret of electroweak symmetry breaking will be revealed at this scale. 
Second, the exciting idea of super symmetry, which offers the hope of great 
insights into unification of all the forces of nature, predicts that a rich 
array of new particles can be produced. Finally, we will obtain the first 
glimpse of physics well above the typical mass scale of the Standard Model. In 
the past, when such a large step has been taken, dramatic experimental surprises 
have occurred. One might expect that similar revolutionary discoveries will be 
made at the TeV mass scale. <br>
<br>
<br>
========================================================= <br>
<br>
&nbsp; Other problems of great importance to the understanding of elementary 
particles do not require the highest energies for elucidation. One is 
understanding rare quark and lepton transitions. Another is the nature of CP 
violation—a phenomenon that bears on the apparent dominance of matter over 
antimatter in the universe. There are additional astrophysical questions of 
great importance that can likely be explained by particle physics dynamics, the 
most important being the nature of dark matter. A number of the most important 
findings in the field in the past two decades have been made by experiments 
studying problems such as these, and facilities presently being upgraded or 
under construction will allow such studies to continue. The committee believes 
it is crucial to support a well-targeted program in these areas. Given the 
limited resources that will be available, however, maintaining a proper balance 
between such efforts and those at the energy frontier will require difficult 
choices and keen foresight. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; Advances in elementary-particle physics have historically been tied to 
advances in accelerator technology. Accelerator research and development is of 
two general types—efforts targeted at the design and construction of specific 
facilities and more generic (and forward-looking) R&amp;D targeting completely new 
methods of acceleration that will be required to support energy frontier 
facilities decades from now, should the physics demand it. This report contains 
specific recommendations with regard to the former. It is necessary to maintain 
an appropriate level of investigation in the latter area to secure the 
longer-term future of the field. Theoretical work in elementary-particle physics 
provides the intellectual foundation that motivates and interconnects much of 
experimental research. The more formal areas of theoretical physics, especially 
string theory, hold the promise of providing a picture of the universe that 
accounts for an extremely broad range of observations and phenomena. The 
committee believes that a healthy level of activity both in formal areas and in 
the more phenomenological investigations that touch directly on experiments now 
and in the coming decade should be maintained. Although the LHC will be the 
first machine to extensively explore electroweak symmetry breaking, some of the 
new particles associated with the TeV scale might exist within the reach of the 
Tevatron. In particular, the upgraded Tevatron collider facility might discover 
supersymmetry. This would dramatically enhance our understanding of the 
universe. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; In the middle of the next decade, the LHC will supersede the Tevatron Collider 
as the highest-energy machine in the world. U.S. physicists, with their 
extensive experience at Fermilab and in the research and development toward 
construction and use of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), have 
established critical roles in the construction of the LHC machine and of the two 
largest experiments. The resources involved have been established in an 
agreement reached in 1997 by the Department of Energy, the National Science 
Foundation, and CERN, the host laboratory. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; A collider that complements or extends the reach of the LHC will require 
multiyear and multinational cooperation because of the magnitude of the 
resources needed. If the United States is to maintain a leadership role in this 
enterprise, it must participate both in accelerator technology development and 
in international decisions on the choice of technology and the location of the 
next facility. Although it is highly desirable to have a forefront facility 
located within the United States, it is crucial that the United States maintain 
a technological base sufficient to allow full participation in all aspects of 
the design, construction, and operation of such a facility, independent of its 
ultimate location. <br>
<br>
In the mean time, at least the rest of us can reap the benefits of science 
pro-bono!!<br>

science are more sublime than the character of some people...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, as Einstein (1907) first showed, if we consider a physical system 
composed of point-particles, such as an ideal gas, the entire system can be 
considered as a single point-particle whose inertial mass increases as the 
kinetic energies of the component particles increase. Many particle-antiparticle 
collisions have been observed, such as collisions between electrons and 
positrons, where the entire mass of the particles is radiated away as energy in 
the form of light. Nevertheless, SR leaves open the possibility that a form of 
matter exists whose mass cannot become energy. This is significant because it 
emphasizes that mass-energy equivalence is not a consequence of a theory of 
matter; it is instead a direct consequence of changes to the structure of 
spacetime imposed by SR (see Section 3, Derivations of Mass-Energy Equivalence: 
History). <br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consequently, Einstein and Infeld argue, the distinction between matter and 
fields is no longer a qualitative one in relativistic physics. Instead, it is 
merely a quantitative difference, since &quot;matter is where the concentration of 
energy is great, field where the concentration of energy is small&quot;(1938, p. 
242). Thus, Einstein and Infeld conclude, mass-energy equivalence entails that 
we should adopt an ontology consisting only of fields. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, in Human Knowledge, Its Scope and Limits, he points out that 
&quot;atoms&quot; are merely small regions in which there is a great deal of energy. 
Furthermore, these regions are precisely the regions where one would have said, 
in pre- relativistic physics, that there was matter. For Russell, these 
considerations suggest that &quot;mass is only a form of energy, and there is no 
reason why matter should not be dissolved into other forms of energy. It is 
energy, not matter, that is fundamental in physics&quot; (1948, p. 291). Russell is 
proposing that mass is reducible to energy in the sense that the world consists 
only of energy. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Einstein's further conclusion that &quot;the mass of a body is a measure of its 
energy content&quot; (1905b, p. 71) does not, strictly speaking, follow from his 
argument. As Torretti (1983) and other philosophers and physicists have 
observed, Einstein's (1905b) argument allows for the possibility that once a 
body's energy store has been entirely used up (and subtracted from the mass 
using the mass-energy equivalence relation) the remainder is not zero. In other 
words, it is only an hypothesis in Einstein's (1905b) argument, and indeed in 
all derivations of E = mc2 in SR, that no &quot;exotic matter&quot; exists that is not 
convertible into energy (see Ehlers, Rindler, Penrose, (1965) for a discussion 
of this point). However, particle-antiparticle annihilation experiments in 
atomic physics, which were first observed decades after 1905, strongly support 
&quot;Einstein's dauntless extrapolation&quot; (Torretti, 1983, p. 112). <br>

Besides being required for ultra-precision subatomic microscopy, particles from 
accelerators colliding with target particles may lead to the creation of new 
particles, which acquire their mass from the collision energy according to the 
formula E=mc2. It is thus by conversion to mass of excess kinetic energy in a 
collision that particles, antiparticles and exotic nuclei can be created. <br>

I guess god does indeed like to &quot;play dice....&quot; but the more important concern 
is choice in considering our perceptions of caring and fairness... <br>

Poverty, Inequality and the Distribution of Income in the G20 <br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The world distribution of income is the aggregate of all the individual country 
density functions. The G20 distribution is the aggregate of all countries in the 
G20. We notice that the World Distribution and the G20 Distribution are quite 
similar. The reason is that the G20 account for 63 % of the world’s population. 
The modes of both the G20 and the World distributions in 1970 occur at $900, 
below the two-dollar poverty line. About one half of the area under the G20 
distribution lies to the left of the two-dollar line and almost one fifth-lays 
below the one-dollar line. The fraction of the G20 and world population living 
in poverty in 1970 was, therefore, staggering! 6 The distribution seems to have 
a local maximum at $8,700, which mainly captures the larger levels of income of
<br>
the United States, Japan, and Europe. Russia seems to be somewhere in between&quot; (Mahaptra, 
9). <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A second important difference between our estimates and those of the World Bank 
is that we scale individual income shares by GDP or Consumption as reported by 
the National Accounts whereas the World Bank adjusts by the average consumption 
reported by the surveys. It is well known that surveys tend to underestimate 
true consumption since people tend to underreport their consumption (or income). 
Bhalla (2002) estimates that the ratio of the mean consumption of the surveys to 
National Account consumption is as low as 0.73. If we divide our estimated 
poverty rates by 0.73 we would get that our consumption poverty rates for 
$1/day&nbsp; would be 4.11% or 164 <br>
million people. With the adjustments, the $2/day poverty rate in 1998 would be 
49% or 1.8 billion. ( Mahaptra, 12). <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These complex patterns of changes show us that we should think twice about 
simplistic characterizations of global economic change 'making the rich, richer, 
and the poor, poorer'. In fact, the poor in the G-20 (and the broader world) 
have been getting richer in unprecedented numbers, and beginning slowly to 
reduce the relative gap with the rich. We need to think more carefully about 
absolute poverty, relative poverty, intercountry inequality and intra-country 
inequality. What do we really care about most, and why? What can we change, and 
how? <br>
The success of the G20 has been remarkable, but success does not mean victory. 
The number of poor is still embarrassingly large: in 1998, about 450 million 
people still had an income of less than two dollars a day. And even if the G20 
is succeeding, the world at large is losing an important battle: the battle of 
Africa. In the 1970s, poverty was essentially an Asian phenomenon. It is now 
mainly an African problem. And, while the most powerful nations of the world can 
be happy about their performance and their success, they cannot be entirely 
happy with the state of the planet. The lessons learned in the G20 countries 
need to be applied to Africa. And they need to be applied fast.&nbsp; (Mahaptra, 15)

If might is right, then we should be using our brains to systematically torture 
all the variations of life (and for that matter death) all around us.... 
Fortunately for us, we get to benefit from 30 years of research by Cal Tech 
professors... and as it turns out, natures doesn't discriminate between 
species.... <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Although even the most educated people certainly have the capacity and 
freedom to choose how much pain and suffering they want to inflict onto 
others... For without Choice it wouldn't be much of an existence!! <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Perception That Might Is Right... <br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/about/">http://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/about/
</a> <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The important question then becomes how altruistic you want to be.... for 
without social altruism there would be no women's right movement, rights for 
minorities, no public education, welfare for the mentally or physically disabled or a living wage for 
the working class... <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Some women have used feminist jurisprudence to turn 
the scales of justice So Much that men are now often reduced to nothing more 
than pocketbooks -- as opposed being perceived as caring and companionate 
fathers who deserve their children as much as their wives... More to the point, 
by attaining and maintaining perceptions of caring and &quot;fairness,&quot; I hope that a 
50% divorce rate will not continue to be the Norm but rather a disastrous 
consequence of greed... <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is amazing what you can accomplish by changing people's 
perception! As of today's realty, unless you have deep pockets I wouldn't mess 
with them, they'll take half your money (if you have any) and you'll be writing 
checks until the day you...or go to jail!<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; What I want to know is... how is this any different than a man telling his 
wife, I've become accustomed to your affection and I require monetary 
compensation if you leave me :) <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But then, not everyone thinks like that... Thank goodness <br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully this drama will go in the positive direction as more and 
more people Choose to believe in attaining and maintaining perceptions of caring 
and &quot;fairness,&quot; which is based on our underlying assumptions and continual 
learning and growth! </font></tt></p>
