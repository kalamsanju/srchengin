        <p>Perhaps you are a brilliant writer, or maybe you're just going for the most efficient way to rack up the college <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-money/">scholarship money</a>. Either way, you’ve decided that the key to <a href="/financial-aid/funding-your-education/">funding your education </a>lies in winning <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarships-by-type/essay-scholarships/">scholarship essay contests</a>. Essay scholarships are awarded in numerous fields to students of varied backgrounds. Some essay scholarships have requirements in addition to the essay, such as GPA or financial need, whereas others are judged solely on the merit of the writing submitted. No matter what the criteria are, essay scholarships are a great way to use those writing skills you’ve been practicing to help <a href="/financial-aid/financial-aid-information/pay-for-school/">pay for school</a>.</p><div style="max-width: 720px; margin: auto;">

<p>The <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/scholarship-strategy-the-scholarship-application-process/"> scholarship application process</a> for essay scholarships is much the same as for other <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-information/scholarship-opportunities/">scholarship opportunities</a>—you need to fill out the scholarship application, gather all your materials, double-check that you've met all requirements, and then submit your completed application packet before the deadline. With essay scholarships, especially, you should start this process early and leave yourself plenty of time to formulate an effective strategy and write a brilliant entry. Make sure you closely follow instructions and go through the entire writing process, from brainstorming to outlining to editing. If you really want to win essay scholarships, you can't just throw your response together in 30 minutes and send it on its way. While this strategy may have worked for you in English class, chances are $5,000 wasn't riding on whether you got an A on any of your papers. Take your time writing and revising. If you plan far enough ahead, you'll be able to get plenty of feedback from your family, friends, and teachers, as well. The more people who see your essay, the better it will be. Outside help goes beyond proofreading. If possible, ask for advice on the content of your essay, as well as the style and the flow. All of these are important factors in <a href="/financial-aid/college-scholarships/scholarship-application-strategies/top-10-tips-for-writing-effective-scholarship-essays/">writing effective scholarship essays</a>. </p> <div style="padding: 15px 0px 15px 0px;">
